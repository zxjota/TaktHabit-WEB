    <h1>Privacy Policy — TaktHabit</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective date: November 15, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>TaktHabit</strong> ("we", "us" or "our"). Your privacy matters. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use and share it, your choices, and how to contact us. This policy applies to the TaktHabit mobile application and any related services or websites operated by TaktHabit.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information you provide directly and information collected automatically when you use TaktHabit.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Email address, username, and other profile data you provide when you create an account.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage and analytics:</strong> Information about how you use the app, such as feature usage, app events, session duration, and crash reports.</li>
      <li><strong>Device and technical data:</strong> Device identifiers, operating system version, model, app version, language, and IP address.</li>
      <li><strong>Content and user data:</strong> Data you choose to store in the app (for example habit names, timestamps, notes). This content is controlled by you and stored as described below.</li>
      <li><strong>Push notifications:</strong> If you opt in, we collect your device token to deliver notifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Third-party data:</strong> If you connect to third-party services (e.g., sign-in providers, analytics providers), we may receive information from those services in accordance with their terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, maintain, and improve TaktHabit.</li>
      <li>Personalize your experience and provide relevant features.</li>
      <li>Send transactional messages such as account confirmations, security alerts, and support responses.</li>
      <li>Analyze usage trends to understand and improve the app.</li>
      <li>Detect, investigate, and prevent security incidents and fraud.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> With vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, analytics, crash reporting, push notifications). They only receive the data necessary to perform their services and are bound by confidentiality obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> If required by law or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, to protect rights, property or safety, or to enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets — users will be notified and, where required by law, given choices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. However, no security system is impenetrable. If a data breach occurs, we will follow applicable laws and notify you as required.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information as long as necessary to provide our services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. If you delete your account, we will remove or de-identify personal information within a reasonable timeframe, except where retention is required by law.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access & correction:</strong> You may review, update, or delete your account information in the app or by contacting us.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can opt out of push notifications through your device settings or within the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies and tracking:</strong> If using a web interface, you can control cookie settings through your browser. You may also opt out of analytics tracking where applicable (see below for third-party links).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
    <p>TaktHabit may use third-party services for analytics, crash reporting, and messaging. Those third parties collect and process data according to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies as well. The app may also contain links to third-party websites; we are not responsible for their content or privacy practices.</p>

    <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed or stored in countries other than your own. When we transfer personal information across borders, we take steps to ensure it is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>TaktHabit is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected such information, we will delete it as required by law.</p>

    <h2>10. California Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) such as the right to know, delete, and opt-out of the sale of personal information. We do not sell personal information. To exercise your California privacy rights, contact us using the details below.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated policy in the app or provide notice within the app and update the "Effective date" at the top. Your continued use of TaktHabit after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
